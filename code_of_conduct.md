# Code of Conduct

## ND in Tech Mission Statement

Neurodiversity In Tech (ND in Tech, for short) is an online community dedicated to supporting neurodiverse professionals in the technology industry. Our mission is to enable members to network, navigate their careers, and empower each other while advocating for meaningful social change. ND in Tech serves as a crucial hub for sharing experiences, offering support, and promoting inclusivity within the tech world. We aim to create a welcoming environment where diversity is celebrated and every individual feels valued. It's a space committed to making the tech industry more inclusive and diverse, empowering its members to advocate for themselves and each other.

## Scope of This Code of Conduct

This code of conduct applies to interactions of community members in Slack and online or in-person meet-ups. There are situations outside of the control of ND in Tech representatives. We do not make claims that we can enforce this code of conduct in these and other scenarios:

- Interactions on other online platforms not administered by ND in Tech representatives.
- In-person meet-ups not sponsored by ND in Tech.

## Community Membership/Inclusion

Membership is for neurodiverse professionals in technology or those who support such individuals in a professional capacity. A medical diagnosis is not needed to join the community.

## Expected Behavior

- Bring your authentic self.
- Treat all members with dignity and respect.
- Support and uplift members of the community.
- [Assume positive intent](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/mind-the-manager/202203/when-in-doubt-assume-positive-intent).
- Keep conversation roughly in line with the subject of the channels in Slack - there are plenty of channels that cover a variety of conversational topics.
  - Channels prefixed with **community-** focus on topics important to a specific demographic.
  - Channels prefixed with **interest-** are for discussions around professional development, hobbies, etc.
  - Channels prefixed with **flavored-** or **challenge-** focus around advice-seeking and outlets for health-related discussions.
  - **tool-accommodations** focuses on technical solutions or strategies to address specific needs
  - **#introductions** is a place to say hi to new people and for them to get advice on how to navigate our community.
  - **#general** and **#announcements** provide centralized places for announcements and discussion about the community.
  - **#random** is a catch-all
- Intercede or report any abusive or malicious behavior towards other members. Don't assume that ND in Tech representatives will see it unless they are already actively responding.

## Unacceptable Behavior

### Harassment

#### Sexual Harassment

- No unwanted flirting or sexual advances.
- No sexually obscene conversation or observations.
- No slurs against marginalized groups.

#### Verbal / Written Harassment

- No non-consensual teasing or jokes at another person's expense.
- No unsolicited advice.
- No [Schrodinger's Assholes](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Schrodingers%20asshole).

#### Elitism/Gatekeeping/Exclusion

- We do not require our members to have an official diagnosis. This group focuses on supporting those who are neurodiverse and work in tech which. Our community focus does not include neurotypical people but that is only a matter of focus, not exclusion.
- There is not a universal "presentation" for any specific neurodiverse sub-group - behavioral, appearance, or philosophic outlooks.
- We do not tolerate exclusion of people because they aren't {{insert clinical diagnosis here}} enough.

### Racism / Sexism

- Justâ€¦no.

### Violence

- Threats of physical harm will not be tolerated.
- No conversations focused on violence or acts of harm unless they support a larger conversation.

## Privacy Concerns

### Intra-community

- Cameras are encouraged during online meetups but not necessary.
- Always ask for permission in Slack prior to connecting with others outside Slack.

### Outside of Community

- Don't "out" people of the community. Some members may not want to let their employers or other professional/personal relations know aspects of what they may consider their personal, private life. If they're comfortable with the wider world knowing about their neurodiversity, they can share that for themselves.
- Don't share another member's personal info including email, phone number, Slack handle, or other [PII](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_data).

## Enforcement

### Reporting Guidelines

- If someone is in imminent physical harm, contact the appropriate emergency services in their area.
- Where possible, attempt to resolve the situation one-on-one with the aggressor. In some cases, there may be a misunderstanding.
- Involve staff where necessary by contacting [nditcommunity@gmail.com](mailto:nditcommunity@gmail.com) or messaging Hayley, Roy, or Jennifer on Slack. Be sure to include:
  - **WHO** the incident happened to and who initiated it
  - **WHAT** happened
  - **WHEN** the incident took place
  - **WHERE** it took place

### Grievance Review Process

If a participant engages in unaccepted behavior, ND in Tech representatives may take any reasonable action they deem appropriate to resolve the issue. This includes but is not limited to:

- issuing a warning to the offender
- expulsion of the offender from ND in Tech Slack and messaging channels
- barring offender from ND in Tech events
